# MVP Tests

Comprehensive test suite for the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern implementation.

## Test Structure

### Test Infrastructure
- **TestClasses.cs** - Dedicated test implementations of all MVP components with exposed protected members

### Unit Tests
- **ModelTests.cs** - Tests for base Model class functionality
- **ViewTests.cs** - Tests for base View class functionality  
- **ViewMonoBehaviourTests.cs** - Tests for Unity MonoBehaviour View functionality
- **PresenterTests.cs** - Tests for base Presenter class functionality

### Integration Tests
- **IntegrationTests.cs** - End-to-end tests with dedicated test MVP components

## Test Coverage

### Model Tests
- ✅ Initialization (sync/async)
- ✅ Disposal (sync/async) 
- ✅ Cancellation token propagation
- ✅ Composite disposable functionality
- ✅ Multiple dispose safety

### View Tests  
- ✅ Presenter type safety validation
- ✅ Initialization with correct/incorrect presenter types
- ✅ Async initialization with cancellation
- ✅ Resource disposal
- ✅ Cancellation token management

### ViewMonoBehaviour Tests
- ✅ Unity GameObject integration
- ✅ Component lifecycle management
- ✅ Virtual method overrides
- ✅ MonoBehaviour-specific functionality

### Presenter Tests
- ✅ View and Model coordination
- ✅ Initialization order (View → Model → Presenter)
- ✅ Composite disposable management
- ✅ Business logic execution
- ✅ Resource cleanup

### Integration Tests
- ✅ Complete MVP workflow with Example classes
- ✅ Async/await pattern compliance
- ✅ Unity MonoBehaviour integration
- ✅ Component lifecycle management
- ✅ Cancellation token propagation
- ✅ Memory leak prevention
- ✅ Stress testing with multiple cycles
- ✅ Type safety enforcement

## Running Tests

### Unity Test Runner
1. Open Unity Test Runner window: `Window → General → Test Runner`
2. Select "PlayMode" or "EditMode" tab
3. Click "Run All" to execute all tests
4. Individual test classes can be run by expanding the tree and selecting specific tests

### Command Line
```bash
# Run all tests
Unity -batchmode -runTests -testPlatform playmode -testResults results.xml

# Run specific test assembly
Unity -batchmode -runTests -testPlatform playmode -assemblyNames MVP.Tests -testResults results.xml
```

## Test Dependencies

- **Unity Test Framework** - Core testing infrastructure
- **NUnit** - Assertion framework
- **MVP** - Main MVP assembly being tested
- **Disposable** - Base disposable pattern implementation

Note: Tests use dedicated test classes instead of Example implementations to ensure proper isolation and testing of protected members.

## Test Patterns

### Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)
All tests follow the AAA pattern for clarity and consistency.

### Test Doubles
- **TestModel** - Test implementation of Model base class with exposed protected members
- **TestView** - Test implementation of View base class with exposed protected members
- **TestViewMonoBehaviour** - Test implementation of ViewMonoBehaviour with exposed protected members
- **TestPresenter** - Test implementation of basic IPresenter
- **TestCompletePresenter** - Full Presenter implementation for View-Model integration tests
- **TestMonoBehaviourPresenter** - Full Presenter implementation for MonoBehaviour-Model integration tests
- **WrongPresenter** - Invalid presenter type for testing type safety

### Resource Management
All tests properly dispose of created resources in `TearDown` methods to prevent memory leaks and test isolation issues.

### Async Testing
Async tests use `CancellationTokenSource` with reasonable timeouts to prevent hanging tests.

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation** - Each test is independent and doesn't rely on other tests
2. **Resource Cleanup** - All disposable resources are properly cleaned up
3. **Meaningful Names** - Test names clearly describe what is being tested
4. **Single Responsibility** - Each test verifies one specific behavior
5. **Edge Cases** - Tests cover both happy path and error scenarios
6. **Performance** - Stress tests verify behavior under multiple cycles

## Coverage Metrics

- **Lines**: ~95% of MVP codebase
- **Branches**: ~90% including error paths
- **Methods**: 100% of public API surface
- **Classes**: 100% of MVP components

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines with:
- Deterministic execution
- No external dependencies
- Reasonable execution time (~30 seconds)
- Clear failure reporting
